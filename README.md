# KPMG-Data-Analytics-Virtual
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation, has approached Tony Smith (Partner) in KPMG’s Lighthouse & Innovation Team. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd  is keen to learn more about KPMG’s expertise in its Analytics, Information & Modelling team. 

Smith discusses KPMG’s expertise in this space (you can read more here). In particular, he speaks about how the team can effectively analyse the datasets to help Sprocket Central Pty Ltd grow its business.

Primarily, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd needs help with its customer and transactions data. The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

However, in order to support the analysis, you speak to the Associate Director for some ideas and she advised that “the importance of optimising the quality of customer datasets cannot be underestimated. The better the quality of the dataset, the better chance you will be able to use it drive company growth.”

The client provided KPMG with 3 datasets:

Customer Demographic 
Customer Addresses
Transactions data in the past 3 months 

First Task : 
Drafted an email to the client identifying the data quality issues and strategies to mitigate these issues.

Second Task :
For context, Sprocket Central Pty Ltd is a long-standing KPMG client whom specialises in high-quality bikes and accessible cycling accessories to riders. Their marketing team is looking to boost business by analysing their existing customer dataset to determine customer trends and behaviour. 

Using the existing 3 datasets (Customer demographic, customer address and transactions) as a labelled dataset, please recommend which of these 1000 new customers should be targeted to drive the most value for the organisation. 

In building this recommendation, we need to start with a PowerPoint presentation which outlines the approach which we will be taking. The client has agreed on a 3 week scope with the following 3 phases as follows - Data Exploration; Model Development and Interpretation.

Prepare a detailed approach for completing the analysis including activities – i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off. Please advise what steps you would take. 

Prepared PowerPoint presentation includes a detailed approach for our strategy behind each of the 3 phases including activities involved in each - i.e. understanding the data distributions, feature engineering, data transformations, modelling, results interpretation and reporting. This detailed plan needs to be presented to the client to get a sign-off.

Final task:
Developed a dashboard that we can present to the client at our next meeting. Displayed our data summary and results of the analysis in the dashboard.  

The following are the details of the analysis done on the dataset.
